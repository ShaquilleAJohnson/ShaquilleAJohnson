## Projects

### Security Operations (SecOps) Research
This project delves into the strategies, tools, and methodologies that enhance threat detection, response, and overall security posture.

#### Key Learnings
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Essential for early threat detection and mitigation.
- **Incident Response**: Effective planning and automation are key to swift and efficient incident handling.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Proactive threat identification through intelligence integration.
- **Automation**: Enhancing efficiency and reducing human error.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular assessments and timely patching are critical for security.

#### Sample Python Code
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load log data
logs = pd.read_csv('security_logs.csv')

# Define suspicious activity rules
def is_suspicious(log):
    if 'failed login' in log['message']:
        return True
    if 'unauthorized access' in log['message']:
        return True
    return False

# Apply rules to identify suspicious logs
logs['suspicious'] = logs.apply(is_suspicious, axis=1)

# Filter suspicious logs
suspicious_logs = logs[logs['suspicious']]

# Save suspicious logs to a file
suspicious_logs.to_csv('suspicious_logs.csv', index=False)

print(f'Total suspicious logs found: {len(suspicious_logs)}')
```
